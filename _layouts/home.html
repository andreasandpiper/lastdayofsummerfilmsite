    It is the last day of summer and Julia is at the local bike shop hoping that
    her bike can be fixed. While waiting she browses the shop until she stumbles
    upon a comic book. The comic explores a world which stylizes the sights and
    sounds she would experience on the trails. Blended with her imagination she
    finds herself on a ride like no other. A young girl hopes that her broken
    bike will be fixed for the last day of summer.
